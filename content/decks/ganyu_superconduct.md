description: AoE DMG is the name of this deck. With the aid of the Superconduct Elemental Reaction, as well as Ganyu's Talents, this deck is able to easily whittle down all three of your opponent's Character Cards in one fell swoop. When your opponent only has one character remaining, finish them off with Keqing!

## Objective
There are two main objectives in Ganyu Superconduct, and they are usually decided by your opening hand and/or dice.


The main objective is to obtain and activate Ganyu’s Elemental Burst, Celestial Shower, as fast as possible. The full DMG value of the summoned Sacred Cryo Pearl will deal 3 AoE DMG to all opposing Character Cards, which assures constant AoE DMG even when Ganyu is removed from play and is less Cryo intensive, at the expense of opening yourself vulnerable to Send Off. <br></br>

Something you can aim for also is to utilize Ganyu’s Talent Card, Undivided Heart, and quickly bursting down your opponent with your newly strengthened attack, Frostflake Arrow. Each Frostflake Arrow after the first deals 3 AoE DMG instead of 2, but as they cost 5 Cryo each, this is extremely intensive on your hand should you lack the Cryo necessary, and may require cards that generate dice to work effectively. <br></br>

As described, your opening hand and dice dictates which objective you might want to gravitate towards, so the cards you try to have in your hand will be different.


## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards="['The Bestest Travel Companion', 'Liben', 'Liu Su', 'Paimon', 'Elemental Resonance: Woven Thunder']"></CardRow>


You should always have at least one of the above cards on hand. The Bestest Travel Companion! is a card that changes two of your unusable dice to Omni Element, and is extremely valuable as always for a deck oriented around Elemental Skills. Elemental Resonance: Woven Thunder adds an extra dice to your arsenal, and cards like Liben and Paimon allows you to spend dice strategically to obtain 2 Omni Element in future Rounds, helping out the deck’s strategies. <br></br>

Generally, as Ganyu Superconduct, you do not have to worry about the opponent’s strategies too much. The only effect that truly damages your strategy is self Hydro application, exhibited by Kokomi, Barbara, and Xingqiu. <br></br>


### Celestial Shower Route
<CardFan :cards="['Liu Su', 'Elemental Resonance: High Voltage', 'Leave It to Me']"></CardFan>


When Liu Su or Elemental Resonance: High Voltage is in your opening hand, you can accelerate Ganyu’s Elemental Burst by switching to her on Round 1. If you have a good hand, you could even perform her Elemental Burst this Round! Moreover, since Ganyu is swapped in later, you should not have to spend dice on defensive options just yet. If you went second, Leave It to Me! is a great utility card for ending the Round and obtaining priority ahead of your opponent, allowing for a guaranteed Superconduct trigger on your Elemental Burst! <br></br>


### Undivided Heart Route
<CardFan :cards="['Changing Shifts', 'Undivided Heart', 'Lotus Flower Crisp']"></CardFan>


If specifically Undivided Heart lands itself in your hand, you can attempt to primarily keep Ganyu as your Active Character to shoot Frostflake Arrows. Activating either Paimon or Liben allows you to obtain 2 extra dice in your next Round, totalling your dice count to 10 and making Frostflake Arrow’s cost less punishing. <br></br>


Once again, this route is very dependent on your Cryo, but also on how well you protect your Ganyu. If you overly commit to attacking, your Ganyu might get defeated, after which you have no more Cryo application and your game plan falls apart. Lotus Flower Crisp helps in protecting your Ganyu, but you’ll find very quickly that most decks can take care of one sitting duck really easily.


## Early Game Plan


Primarily, you begin the game with Fischl as your active character, and perform her Elemental Skill. After that, depending on your hand, you decide upon one of the strategies above. In either method, you switch to Ganyu regardless. <br></br>


Against decks utilizing Sucrose or Jean, you might want to watch your swaps. If you swap to Ganyu, you might potentially be forcibly switched to Keqing or back to Fischl if the opponent still possesses the required dice. Moreover, remember to keep track of the opponent’s high-damage strategies, such as a First Turn Kill, from cards like Diluc, Fatui Pyro Agent, or Klee.


## Mid-Late Game Plan
The next few Rounds after your initial setup should be spent applying more AoE DMG, while also making sure to conserve Ganyu’s HP. In most cases, Ganyu Superconduct wins by the AoE DMG overwhelming the opponent, but some cards like Favonius Cathedral can prevent that from happening. Neither Ganyu nor Fischl are particularly good at single target DMG, so you want to utilize Keqing to do the final blows. Even if your opponent still has all three Character Cards in play, that is fine: once their average HP gets around 3, you can try to finish off the game from there. <br></br>


However, the deck cannot maintain this pressure for too long. As the deck seldom has space to play defensively, it will start to lose advantage in a prolonged battle. Decks that pool their resources into one character, like Noelle, will be able to have that character survive and counterattack with powerful strengthened moves, and simply outmatch the AoE-oriented characters. When playing, keep in mind the damage the opponent can inflict, as well as what characters they’re keeping healthy. <br></br>


### Sacrificing Ganyu?
Due to Keqing being able to finish the game after a large volley of AoE DMG from the other two party members, some Duelists will attempt to exclusively use Ganyu to dish out massive AoE DMG with her Frostflake Arrows, sometimes even choosing to let her be defeated for that cause. <br></br>


While this is definitely a possible game plan with a marginal chance of winning, it is highly unadvised due to the fragility of Ganyu and the inconsistency of your dice. Should your opponent have access to highly damaging cards like Adeptus’ Temptation in their hand, you would be left against three opposing ones with their HP basically untouched, with your Superconduct locked away. <br></br>


Fortunately, Fischl and Keqing both have Elemental Bursts that deal AoE DMG, so you might be able to pull yourself into a possible recovery with cards such as I Haven’t Lost Yet! or the Elemental Resonance: High Voltage from earlier. Don’t bank on it, though, you just locked yourself out of Superconduct.


## Deck Variations
Ganyu Superconduct is very flexible and can be utilized with a great number of cards, and the decklist provided is just a guideline. Aspiring Duelists may see it fit to replace some cards with other promising ones to fulfill different purposes. For example, Starsigns or Calx’s Arts might be utilized to bring forth an Elemental Burst at a faster pace, and Adeptus’ Temptation will make it pack much more of a punch. Quick Knit might extend the Usage(s) of Ganyu’s Sacred Cryo Pearl for further sustaining the AoE pressure, and Dawn Winery might be a Support Card that is able to provide you with further usable dice in each Round. The author recommends Duelists try out interesting cards they might want to use with this deck to truly master it as their own!
