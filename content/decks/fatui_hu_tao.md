## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards="['Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames', 'Northern Smoked Chicken', 'Changing Shifts', 'Liben', 'Timmie']"></CardRow>

Keeping at least one copy of Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames, Northern Smoked Chicken or Changing Shifts is necessary to be able to take down an opposing character on round 1. Paimon, Liben, Timmie and Treasure Seeking Seelie are also good cards to keep as they take time to get their value.

## Early Game Plan


Fatui Hu Tao’s preferred opening is to either start Hu Tao and using Guide to Afterlife into a Charged Attack followed by swapping to Cryo Cicin Mage and use Misty Summons with any of Northern Smoked Chicken, Elemental Resonance: Woven Flames or Changing Shifts or doing it vice versa, which only works with Northern Smoked Chicken. This will do a total of 10 damage if one character takes all of the hits from Hu Tao and Cryo Cicin Mage.

A good alternative play line is to only use Guide to Afterlife into a Charged Attack followed by ramp or Misty Summons into ramp, in case of a Cryo Cicin Mage start. Simply using Hu Tao’s skill followed by 2 Normal Attacks is a fine play if neither ramp nor an extra dice card is available or if the opponent decides to swap out.

The game plan remains mostly the same on round 2 where you continue to deal damage by doing Hu Tao Normal Attacks and Cryo Cicin Mage Skill or Normal Attacks, with the option of using Hu Tao’s burst, Spirit Soother, to potentially get a kill or heal Hu Tao to prevent her from getting killed. However, keeping Hu Tao’s burst for a later point in the game can be a good idea as it is her only source of immediate Pyro damage after Paramita Papillio wears off. 

## Mid-Late Game Plan
<CardRow :cards="['I Haven\'t Lost Yet!', 'Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames', 'Heavy Strike', 'Fatui Conspiracy']"></CardRow>


Round 3 and onwards, Hu Tao will likely no longer have the Paramita Papillio status active anymore as you normally use skill on round 1 while rarely using it again on round 2. This significantly reduces the reliability of the damage she can deal without relying on her burst. Using another Guide to Afterlife is often risky and punishable as Hu Tao can get taken out before your next action. In these cases, you should look to instead go to Fatui Pyro Agent or Cryo Cicin Mage and work towards their bursts.

Cards such as I Haven’t Lost Yet!, Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames, Heavy Strike and Fatui Conspiracy are great for giving the extra push needed to take out an opposing character and close out the match.

## General Gameplay Tips


There are a number of things you need to be mindful of when playing Fatui Hu Tao. Cryo Cicins will lose one usage upon taking elemental reaction damage meaning it’s very important to plan multiple turns ahead to not unnecessarily lose usages on your Cryo Cicins. Furthermore, Hu Tao is a bit of an unconventional character needing 2 dice before she can start dealing Pyro damage as well as requiring an even amount of dice for her Charged Attacks. These restrictions on Hu Tao require extra planning to effectively use Hu Tao. Another thing to note is that, as Blood Blossom is a Character Status on the opponent, it goes off before the opponent’s summons. Moreover, the order for Cryo Cicins and Blood Blossom is dependent on who ended their round first, with Cryo Cicins going first with Blood Blossom going second if you ended first and vice versa. 

## Tech Options
<CardRow :cards="['Liu Su', 'Mondstadt Hash Brown', 'Leave It to Me!']"></CardRow>


Many of the cards in the deck are very powerful and likely mandatory. Therefore, not a lot of cards can be taken out for other options. Nonetheless, there are still some tech options that can be considered. Energy cards like Liu Su and Calx’s Arts are great for allowing characters to burst earlier than normal. More defensive cards like Mondstadt Hashbrown or Send Off are good options for more survivability. Another copy of Leave It to Me!, Heavy Strike or Adeptus Temptation can be considered for more surprise options to take down an opposing character. Some cards that can be taken out for these options are Timmie, Jueyun Guoba and Paimon.
