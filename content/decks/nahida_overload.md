description: Nahida Overload, also called RXN or Nahida Overburn, uses the combined power of Summons, Xiangling's Elemental Burst, and Nahida's Seeds of Skandha to deliver high single target damage with a dash of Piercing Damage to close out games early. Although this deck has no regional or elemental resonance, the character synergy and multitude of reactions (ReaXioNs, if you will) more than makes up for it with its high damage output by Rounds 3-4.

## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Liu Su', 'Liben', 'Vanarana', 'Treasure-Seeking Seelie', 'The Bestest Travel Companion!']"></CardRow>

Liu Su is one of the best cards to have in your opening hand, as it is necessary to execute the best opening with this deck. Dice-fixers such as The Bestest Travel Companion! or Toss-Up are important to ensure you can use Raiden and Xiangling's Elemental Skills on Round 1. Ramp cards such as Liben and Vanarana, while less useful on Round 1, will be important to have ready for ramping on Round 2. If you do draw Liben or Vanarana, it is a good idea to keep Covenant of Rock in your hand to help fill them at the end of Round 1. However, if you have no other way to use Covenant, then mulligan it away. Treasure-Seeking Seelie is a good card to play early in the game to ensure it will be able to draw cards in time for your combo round. If you have Liu Su, a dice-fixer, and a ramp card in your initial hand, it is okay to save Gambler's Earrings for your combo round.

## Early Game Plan

The standard opening is to start with Raiden's Elemental Skill then swap to Xiangling for her Elemental Skill. This opening uses 7 dice, with various options for your last die. If you have Liu Su in hand, playing it before swapping to Xiangling will enable you to use Xiangling's Elemental Burst immediately on Round 2. If you do not have Liu Su, playing Treasure-Seeking Seelie or Strategize prior to Raiden's Elemental Skill is a good alternative. With neither of these three Action Cards in your hand, playing Vanarana or Liben to absorb your one extra die will be helpful for future rounds. <br><br>

If you are facing a deck with first turn kill potential on Round 1, consider using your last die to swap back to Raiden if your opponent has the means to kill Xiangling before she is able to unleash her Elemental Burst. Another option is to ramp immediately after using Raiden's Elemental Skill. If you start the game first, a third option to protect Xiangling is to start with her Elemental Skill first, then Raiden's Elemental Skill, and end the turn on Raiden. Xiangling's Elemental Burst is crucial to the game plan and, therefore, it is devastating to lose her before she is able to cast Pyronado.<br><br>

On Round 2, if your Xiangling is at full energy, use her Elemental Burst and use your remaining dice to ramp for the next round with Vanarana and/or Liben. If she is not at full energy, you may use her Normal Attack and then her Elemental Burst, again saving your remaining dice for ramping or playing Liu Su if you drew it this round. If your Xiangling is in danger of dying, Starsigns can be used to safely deploy her Elemental Burst. Otherwise, it is best to keep Starsigns for a surprise Elemental Burst later in the game for Nahida or Raiden.<br><br>

If there is no safe way for Xiangling to use her Elemental Burst this turn, an alternative is to swap to Nahida early and use her 3-cost or 5-cost Elemental Skill to apply Seeds of Skandha that will be utilized well by the summons during the End Phase.<br><br>

After your Xiangling has used her Elemental Burst, it is okay to sacrifice her to avoid taking damage on Nahida, and for a free swap to Nahida for the next round.

## Mid/Late Game Plan
<CardRow :cards= "['Gambler\'s Earrings', 'I Haven\'t Lost Yet!', 'Adeptus\' Temptation', 'Lotus Flower Crisp']"></CardRow>

By Round 3, your opponent has already suffered 10 DMG from your end-phase summons. It is now time to swap to the core damage dealer of your deck, Nahida, so she can apply Seeds of Skandha to your opponents while inflicting burning damage on her first two hits thanks to Xiangling's Elemental Burst. Each of Nahida's 3-cost Elemental Skills will inflict 6 DMG on the active opposing character, while using her 5-cost Elemental Skill inflicts 7 DMG on the active opposing character and 1 Piercing DMG each to opposing characters on standby. Choose which skill to use based on your dice count (aim for at least 2-3 skills this turn) and the opponent's HP. Before knocking out a character, remember to equip Gambler's Earrings on Nahida so that she can continue to dish out damage.<br><br> 

Consider using Nahida's Elemental Burst if you need strong single-target damage to the active opposing character. It will do a total of 9 DMG if used with Pyronado, Seed of Skandha, and Eye of Stormy Judgment active. Otherwise, continue using 3-cost Elemental Skills if your opponent's key character is on standby.<br><br>

The Burning reactions generated this turn will have summoned a Burning Flame with 1-2 usages, which nicely replaces Guoba such that you may still trigger an Overload reaction during the end of Round 3. 
This deck usually looks to win by Round 3 or the beginning of Round 4. Therefore, it is best to avoid having Nahida knocked out in Round 3 unless you can still ensure your victory. If Nahida does get knocked out before the game ends, Raiden will likely be your last character alive, and it is important to note that she can only deal up-front Elemental Damage with her Elemental Burst. I Haven't Lost Yet! or Starsigns can help provide the final Energy she needs in order to unleash a 4+ DMG Elemental Burst.

 ## Other Options

<CardRow :cards= "['Mushroom Pizza', 'Timmie', 'Calx\'s Arts', 'Paimon', 'Fresh Wind of Freedom']"></CardRow>

Although Nahida Overload has a clear game plan that makes the Action Cards less flexible, some Action Cards are better suited against certain decks. If you are facing a deck that spreads its damage to characters on standby, Mushroom Pizza or an extra Mondstadt Hash Brown may be helpful to keep Nahida healthy before swapping to her in Round 3. Timmie and Paimon are additional ramp options. Calx's Arts is another energy card that may be useful along with a second copy of Starsigns when trying to activate Xiangling's Elemental Burst as soon as possible. Consider replacing one copy of Send Off, Treasure-Seeking Seelie, Vanarana, Adeptus' Temptation, or I Haven't Lost Yet! to fit in these alternative cards. <br><br>

Alongside this, Fresh Wind of Freedom can also be considered as an alternative to Covenant of Rock in order to shut down your opponent's comeback options such as I Haven't Lost Yet! This choice option may come in handy against decks that seek to sacrifice characters for a powerful tactical advantage.
