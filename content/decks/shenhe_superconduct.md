## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Timmie', 'Liben', 'The Bestest Travel Companion!', 'Vanarana', 'Liu Su']"></CardRow>

For the Mulligan, you want to prioritize cards that you will use early game like Timmie. Vanarana and Liben are also good because they can help you carry unused dice to the next round and get turn priority. Always keep one copy of The Bestest Travel Companion! or Toss Up if able. These cards are very useful to help correct your dice in case luck is not on your side, making your gameplay more consistent. Liu Su is also useful because it gives your character 1 energy when you swap to them,which allows you to use their Elemental Burst earlier. <br></br> 

Be careful of decks that are able to do first turn kills. There are some aggressive decks that are able to deal 10 DMG to your character in the first Round, notably double Pyro decks. These decks can eliminate your Raiden Shogun before you are able to charge her Energy for her Elemental BurstRound 2. Consider keeping defensive food cards like Lotus Flower Crisp and Mondstadt Hash Brown against these types of decks.

## Deck Gameplan
<CardRow :cards="['Raiden Shogun', 'Shenhe']"></CardRow>

This deck generally wants to start on Raiden Shogun and use her Elemental Skill to summon Eye of Stormy Judgement, after that you can go with one of two gameplay lines. <br></br>

The first line is swapping to Shenhe and cast her Elemental Skill. This is your preferred line if you have Liu Su in your starting hand. This deals 2 upfront damage and applies Cryo to the enemy character while charging Shenhe’s Burst at the same time. This aggressive opening is good against most decks to give them early pressure from Superconduct and damage from Shenhe’s attacks. <br></br>

The second line is continuing with a Normal Attack on Raiden Shogun to perform an Elemental Burst at the start of Round 2, and then Shenhe's Burst later. This opening allows you to also have 2 Energy on your Chongyun, who can threaten high burst damage from Chongyun which is essential against hypercarry decks. <br></br>

Against decks that have a much slower game plan, you can alternatively start with Chongyun's Elemental Skill before preparing Raiden's Burst. This allows for more Superconduct activations and gives your Chongyun 3 Energy right after Raiden Shogun bursts. This enables even more threats to hypercarry or stall-based opposing characters. <br></br>

Also keep in mind that having Eye of Stormy Judgement and Talisman Spirit guarantees Superconduct during the End Phase, which deals a significant amount of damage to your enemy on top of Shenhe and Raiden Shogun’s damage.


## Closing Out the Game with Chongyun
<CardFan :cards="['Gambler\'s Earrings', 'I Haven\'t Lost Yet!', 'Elemental Resonance: Shattering Ice', 'Chongyun']"></CardFan>

With Icy Quill usages and Talisman Spirit on the field, your Chongyun's Elemental Skill will deal a minimum of 5 DMG, which can defeat a full HP enemy in 2 hits. He also enjoys a 10 DMG Elemental Burst with Eye of Stormy Judgement on the field which can eliminate full HP enemies immediately. Utilize cards such as Elemental Resonance: Shattering Ice to hit enemy HP breakpoints. Cards like Gambler’s Earrings, Elemental Resonance: Woven Ice, and I Haven’t Lost Yet! can also help you finish the game with the extra dice they provide. But be careful, as your Chongyun won't deal as much damage after Shenhe’s Talisman Spirit and Icy Quils run out, make sure you close up the game before that happens.

## Alternative Cards
<CardRow :cards="['Send Off', 'Heavy Strike', 'Stone and Contracts', 'Covenant of Rock', 'Northern Smoked Chicken']"></CardRow>

There are also some card options that you can consider adding to the deck. Stone and Contracts is useful as a ramp card and helps recycle your dice. Covenant of Rock is useful to generate extra dice at the end of the round, opening more options for different plays at the end of the round. Heavy Strike can help you reach higher HP breakpoints on enemies, and Northern Smoked Chicken can let you get a surprise Normal Attack. Send Off is also generally useful against other Summon-based decks.
