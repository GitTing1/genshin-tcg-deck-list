## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Paimon', 'Liben', 'Vanarana', 'Timmie', 'The Bestest Travel Companion!']"></CardRow>

Prioritize obtaining ramp cards during the mulligan, as having Paimon, Liben or Vanarana is essential for executing Nahida Hyperbloom’s preferred opening. While Timmie’s effect is powerful, it requires 2 rounds to activate, making it crucial to have Timmie in hand as early as possible. Dice-fixing cards such as The Bestest Travel Companion! and Toss-Up are important, given that the preferred rotation of Elemental Skills has strict Dice requirements. If you already possess one of the three required ramp cards and a Dice fixer, you can consider keeping powerful cards for Round 3, such as Calx’s Arts and Gambler’s Earrings. <br></br>

## Early Game Plan

The standard opening with Nahida Hyperbloom involves starting with Rhodeia or Nahida’s 5-cost Elemental Skill, The Myriad Wilds or All Schemes to Know: Tathata, followed by ramping with Paimon, Liben, or Vanarana. On Round 2, aim to 5-cost Elemental Skill with Nahida if you started Oceanid or vice versa. Subsequently, switch to Fischl and use Nightrider to summon Oz. This strategy is highly efficient and inflicts substantial damage by the end of Round 2 while only using Elemental Skills. It is recommended to start with Nahida against decks with sustain whereas you start Rhodeia against decks with little to no sustain in addition to situations where the opponent would be unable to remove all the usages from Oceanic Mimic: Frog. Don’t hesitate to sacrifice 3-4 cards for Elemental Tuning to follow this opener, especially if you lack alternative Dice-utilizing options. <br></br>

In the event that you don’t draw any of your 3 ramp cards, start on Rhodeia and use Rhodeia’s 3-cost Elemental Skill, Oceanid Mimic Summoning, followed by Fischl’s Elemental Skill, Nightrider. If you have Changing Shifts and sufficient dice, you can opt for Rhodeia’s 5-cost Elemental Skill instead of the 3-cost variant followed by Fischl’s Elemental Skill. With multiple ramp cards in hand, you can opt for a slower approach, focusing primarily on summoning with Rhodeia and Fischl. This tactic can be particularly effective in preventing the spreading of Elemental Auras across all your characters, thereby making you less vulnerable on Round 3 where most decks are looking to close out the game. <br></br>

## Mid/Late Game Plan
<CardRow :cards= "['Calx\'s Arts', 'I Haven\'t Lost Yet', 'Adeptus\' Temptation']"></CardRow>

A considerable amount of the deck’s damage comes from Summons which is increased further in combination with Nahida’s Elemental Skills which apply Seed of Skandha and her Elemental Burst, Illusory Heart. Because of this, it is important to survive until the end of Round 3 to get value from your Summons. <br></br>

At the start of Round 3, you usually want to swap to either Rhodeia or Nahida and use one of their Elemental Skills. If you have Calx’s Arts you can use it to relocate Energy to use a powerful Elemental Burst like Fischl’s Midnight Phantasmagoria to deal AoE damage or Rhodeia’s Tide and Torrent if dealing damage to a single target is more desirable. In addition to Calx’s Arts, cards such as I Haven’t Lost Yet! and Adeptus’ Temptation can also help you take out a threatening unit. Food Cards such as Mondstadt Hash Browns and Lotus Flower Crisp can give you the added sustain needed to survive past Round 3. In longer games such as against decks with more sustain, focus on maintaining your Summons while gradually building up your Energy instead of rushing out your burst. <br></br>

## Other Options
<CardRow :cards= "['Send Off', 'Rana', 'Kid Kujirai', 'Starsigns', 'Covenant of Rock']"></CardRow>

Nahida Hyperbloom has a fairly simple and streamlined game plan which means there aren’t many viable alternatives for Action Cards. Send Off is a great card against other summon-reliant decks as it slows down their game plan making it much easier to survive until Round 4. Rana is another ramp card that allows you to go for the standard opening while also providing value for Round 3 and onwards. Kid Kujirai provides an Omni Die the Round after it is played which can provide the extra push needed on Round 3. Starsigns is another Energy card that can allow you to get to a powerful Elemental Burst to seal the game. Lastly, Covenant of Rock is the best Arcane Legend Card the deck can use and can provide 2 Dice but has a strict activation requirement and has the added downside of lowering the consistency of the deck by always appearing in the starting mulligan. You can consider taking out Strategize, Gambler’s Earrings, one copy of Leave It to Me! or one copy of Adeptus’ Temptation to put in these cards. <br></br>
