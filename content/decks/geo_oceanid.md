## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Tenshukaku', 'Vanarana', 'Liben', 'Liyue Harbor Wharf', 'Tenacity of the Millelith']"></CardRow>

In your mulligan, try to look for cards that help you either use up or carry over dice to the next round. Ramp cards such as Tenshukaku, Vanarana and Paimon are great for providing more dice for following rounds. Draw cards such as Liyue Harbor Wharf and Liben are good for allowing you to draw more key cards in your deck. Tenacity of the Millelith and, to a lesser extent, Vortex Vanquisher are good to keep as they are essential for Zhongli to carry. 

## Early Game:
<CardFan :cards="['Stonehide Lawachurl', 'Rhodeia of Loch']"></CardFan>

You always want to start Rhodeia on Round 1. In the first two rounds, you want to use a lot of your dice on ramp, draw and setting up Zhongli’s equips.Therefore, most of the time, you want to use Rhodeia’s 3 cost Elemental Skill, Oceanid Mimic Summoning, to summon an Oceanid Mimic while spending the rest of your dice on action cards. While Rhodeia’s 5 cost Elemental Skill, Myriad Wilds, may seem appealing, it does not provide any more application than simply using the 3 cost Elemental Skill in addition to being more expensive and having more stringent dice requirements. In the case of bad dice round 1, use Rhodeia’s Normal Attack or use up all your dice for action cards. <br></br>

On round 2, if you do not have an Oceanid Mimic summon on the field, use Rhodeia’s 3 cost Elemental Skill as you want to have a summon that can apply an element at all times. If you have an Oceanid Mimic on the field, you can swap to Lawachurl and use either a Normal Attack or an Elemental Skill depending on your dice. You can use up the rest of your dice by attacking additional times with Lawachurl if needed. If possible, try to use up a lot of your dice on action cards.  Round 2 is a good time to Equip Zhongli with either Tenacity of the Millelith or Vortex Vanquisher if you can. Setting up Zhongli is especially valuable against decks that struggle to break through his shields.

## Mid/Late Game
<CardRow :cards= "['Zhongli']"></CardRow>

In the mid-game, focus on keeping Zhongli healthy. If you have already equipped Zhongli with one of Vortex Vanquisher or Tenacity of the Millelith, you can try to get value with them by swapping to Zhongli and using either his 3 or 5 cost Elemental Skill. Otherwise, try to limit the opponents options by threatening a kill on one of their characters with Elemental Bursts from Lawachurl or Rhodeia. However, if necessary, do not be afraid of letting both Rhodeia and Lawachurl die to set up on Zhongli and ramp. <br></br>

The late-game is when Zhongli truly begins to shine. Equipped with Tenacity of the Millelith and Vortex Vanquisher, Zhongli can be extremely hard to break through. Focus on using Zhongli’s 5 cost Elemental Skill to create a Jade Shield, slowing the opponent’s progress while chipping away at them. Furthermore, cards such as Elemental Resonance: Enduring Rock and Lotus Flower Crisp allows Zhongli to tank even more damage. Zhongli’s Elemental Burst allows him to petrify opposing characters, giving him the ability to stop opposing threats while basically all but guaranteeing a win in a 1v1 situation.

## General Gameplay Tips
<CardRow :cards="['Tenshukaku', 'Abyssal Summons']"></CardRow>

When using Tenshukaku during the same round as other ramp cards, make sure to play it after your other ramp cards as the dice from the earlier ramp cards will be accounted for when Tenshukaku checks for 5 different types of dice. Therefore, it is recommended to play Vanarana and Liben before Tenshukaku even if you will be left with 0 dice remaining. Abyssal Summons should mainly be used to apply an element to trigger Crystallize. However, using it between two Oceanid Mimics or before using an Elemental Burst with Rhodeia are also viable options. Lastly, aim to end your round before your opponent in the late-game so that you can use Zhongli’s 5 cost skill or actions cards to survive your opponent’s attacks.

## Tech Options
<CardRow :cards="['Send Off', 'Adeptus\' Temptation', 'Starsigns', 'Ancient Courtyard', 'Covenant of Rock']"></CardRow>

Geoceanid has a few options it can choose between depending on what matchups you want to prepare for. A big one is Send Off which is very powerful against decks that make use of summons. You can put in cards such as another Mondstadt Hash Brown or Favonius Cathedral if you want more healing. Cards such as Adeptus’ Temptation, Heavy Strike or Starsigns are good for giving you more options and can be the extra push you need to get an essential kill. Lastly, the Arcane cards: Ancient Courtyard and Covenant of Rock have powerful effects that give an effective 2 extra dice, but are reliant on other cards in your deck to function. They are also guaranteed to be in your starting hand which is usually bad as a lot of other cards are more important Round 1. Consider taking out cards such as: The Bestest Travel Companion!, Mondstadt Hash Brown, Paimon or a copy of Vanarana for these cards.
