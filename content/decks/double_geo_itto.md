description: Double Geo Itto aims to build Itto’s powerful burst to sweep the enemy in one combo round, while protecting Itto through the use of powerful Equipment Cards such as Tenacity of the Millelith and The Bell. In addition, the deck can leverage Barbara’s Melody Loop alongside cards like Tenshukaku to outlast and outvalue the opponent during the end game. Finish the game with the powerful Wind and Freedom combined with Heavy Strike, removing all potential counterplays from your opponent.

## Mulligan
<CardRow :cards= "['Tenacity of the Millelith', 'The Bell', 'Liben', 'Liyue Harbor Wharf', 'Tenshukaku']"></CardRow>

Prioritise draw cards and cards that gain value over time in your mulligan. Liben and Liyue Harbor Wharf improves your hand size, providing earlier access to high-value cards such as Tenacity of the Millelith, while accumulating useful cards for subsequent rounds. Tenshukaku, The Bell and particularly Tenacity of the Millelith appreciate in value with each passing round, granting you an advantage in extended games. Vanarana, although not generating dice, allows you to comfortably allocate leftover dice for the next round. It is advisable to keep your arcane card during the mulligan phase due to its potency and the reasonable chance of not drawing it again.

## Early Game Plan

The flexibility of Double Geo Itto allows for various starting approaches. The general objective is to ensure Itto's survival while building energy for his burst, obtaining at least 2 Superlative Superstrength stacks, and ideally equipping him with Tenacity of the Millelith and The Bell. <br></br>

In most cases, your starting character will be Itto. Equip one of the Equipment Cards if available, and use Itto’s Elemental Skill, Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst! followed by a Normal Attack or Ramp. For some decks, it's recommended to switch out before ramping to prevent excessive damage to Itto. Against more aggressive decks capable of substantial early damage, start with Barbara's Elemental Skill, Let the Show Begin♪, followed by swapping between characters to exploit Melody Loop’s End Phase Hydro Application and healing. With a favourable starting hand, you can start on either Noelle or Barbara to safely use all your dice on Action Cards. <br></br>

On the second round, continue accumulating energy and Superlative Superstrength stacks on Itto or summon Melody Loop and ramp if not done previously. However, against combo-centric decks with high single-round damage output, focus solely on getting up Itto’s burst and dealing damage, as it is challenging to outlast your opponent’s combo round.

## Mid/Late Game Plan

Your strategy will be different depending on what type of deck the opponent is playing. Against aggressive decks, your long-term value will eventually bring you victory if you prioritize survival. In such matchups, Barbara's Elemental Burst, Shining Miracle♪, becomes a game-winning tool. In other matchups, however, the goal is to win by using Itto’s Elemental Burst, Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!, to gain Raging Oni King and threaten very substantial damage in a single round. <br></br>

From round 3 onward, many decks become much more threatening, increasing the importance of calculating the maximum potential damage the opponent can, especially to Itto. Be mindful of the opponent’s available options, as cards like Leave It to Me! and Calx’s Arts, alongside damage-amplifying cards such as Adeptus’ Temptation and Elemental Resonance: Fervent Flames. These cards are easily capable of taking down Itto if unprepared. This can be highly detrimental to your gameplan, especially if Itto is equipped with both The Bell and Tenacity of the Millelith.  <br></br>

If the opponent lacks the means to take out Itto, you can safely amass energy for his Elemental Burst or deploy it immediately if already available. Should the opponent recklessly expend their dice, Itto can seize the opportunity to swap in and inflict massive damage with Raging Oni King attached, limiting your opponent's options. Therefore, consider biding your time, allowing the opponent to deplete their dice by swapping between Barbara and Noelle. If you have Tenacity of the Millelith equipped, aim to maximise its value, as it provides a substantial 2 Shield points and an additional die each round when hit. Note that the longer the game goes, the more advantageous it becomes for you, as your cards appreciate in value each round. <br></br>

Don’t hesitate to sacrifice Barbara or Noelle later in the game to soak up damage and safely deploy Itto. When you are ready to combo with Itto, use Geo Resonance: Enduring Rock and Food Cards such as Lotus Flower Crisp to keep Itto out of kill range. Heavy Strike adds the extra damage needed for a kill, while Wind and Freedom can keep Itto safe by allowing another action before the opponent gets to respond. In the event that Itto is unexpectedly defeated, Noelle serves as a reliable backup carry, with good survivability, decent damage output with her Elemental Burst, and the ability to equip The Bell similar to Itto.

## Other Options
<CardRow :cards= "['Ancient Courtyard', 'Strategize', 'Sumeru City', 'Gambler\'s Earrings', 'Guardian\'s Oath']"></CardRow>

The flexibility of Double Geo Itto extends to deck building, with multiple tech options that can be considered in the deck. Below are some noteworthy choices. <br></br>

Ancient Courtyard is another Arcane Legend card that can be used in place of Covenant of Rock but is reliant on drawing Equipment Cards to be useful. Strategize provides more card draw, which is always useful, and has the added benefit of being immediate. Sumeru City serves as an alternative permanent ramp option that can replace or be used alongside Tenshukaku, pairing nicely with the aforementioned Strategize. Including a copy of Gambler’s Earrings can provide the extra dice needed to sweep all of the opponent’s characters in a single round. An extra Wind and Freedom, Tubby, Calx’s Arts or Guardian’s Oath are also feasible options. To fit in the cards you want, consider replacing Mondstadt Hashbrowns, I Haven’t Lost Yet, Send Off or a copy of Heavy Strike.
